Now that you're famiilar enough with some of the common Unix commands, here's a bunch of commands I find useful.

* `bc` - arbitrary precision calculator
* `pushd` / `popd` - maintains a stack of directories you have visited
* `wc` - counts lines, word and characters from its inputs
* `find` - searches the file system
* `which` - displays where the command that you passed is located (`which ls`)
* `diff` - display a difference between arguments (`diff file1 file2`)
* `pwd` - displays the current working directory
* `strings` - displays the printable strings in a given file
* `wget` - retrieve a website
* `tee` - duplicate standard output
